            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>SOME Conſiderations: Humbly Offered to Demonſtrate <hi>How prejudicial it would be to the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Plantations, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the Crown, the Navigation and general Good of this Kingdom, that the ſole Trade for Negroes ſhould be granted to a Company with a Joynt-Stock excluſive to all others.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe great and unſpeakable Advantage the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are to <hi>England,</hi> is ſo well known, that it needs no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration to prove it. The only thing Neceſſary, is to endeavour to improve and increaſe this mighty advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Trade, by ſecuring them from the Inſults of their Enemies, and enabling them to make larger quantities of the Commodities of thoſe Colonies.</p>
            <p>Now the means moſt conducive thereunto will be to make the Trade to <hi>Affrica</hi> open and free for all the Native Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> which Trade for Slaves is chiefly from <hi>Acra</hi> to <hi>Angola,</hi> and contains a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 1200 Miles Sea-coſt, in which extent the preſent <hi>Affrican</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany have neither Fort, Caſtle, nor Factory; ſo that they have not the leaſt colour for a Pretence to an excluſive Right of Trade into thoſe Parts.</p>
            <p>It is well known, that the Riches of the Plantations conſiſts in Slaves chiefly, by whoſe ſtrength and labour all their Commodities, as To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, Sugar, Cotton, Indigo, Ginger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are produced; and the more Slaves thoſe Plantations are ſupplyed with, the more Commodities are made, and the ſtronger they are to defend themſelves againſt any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults. Neither can there be any more danger of being over-ſtockt with Negroes, than there is that too much Tobacco, Sugar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould be ſent to <hi>England;</hi> for it is a plain conſequence, the more Negroes the more Goods will be produced, the more Goods the more Cuſtom paid, and all thoſe Commodities rendered here at home ſo cheap as will enable this Nation to ſend them abroad cheap alſo, to the great diſcouraging of the Plantation-Trade of all other Nations. Wherefore it is very plain, that a large ſupply of Negroes will not only bring great Riches to this Kingdom, but will alſo greatly Increaſe our Navigation.</p>
            <p>Whereas on the contrary, ſhould the <hi>Affrican</hi> Trade be incloſed, and confin'd to the Wills and Powers of a Company, the conſequence would prove as fatal to the Plantations as a Power given to one Perſon in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to ſupply the Gardners with Servants, and the Farmers and Carriers
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34735:2"/>with Horſes: It is not to be doubted that the one would be conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pay yearly for his Servants as much as his Years product would amount to, and the other for his Team as much as the Rent of his Farm, which would prove great Diſcouragements to their Labour and Induſtry. This may we reaſonably ſuppoſe would be the Caſe of the Planters in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> were there but one Perſon that muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them with Slaves, they being ſo extreamly Neceſſary, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to live without them, every Man being rich or poor according to his Stock in Slaves. A Man that may be Proprietor of 10000 Acres of Land, would ſtill be poor had he no ſtock of Negroes to employ upon it.</p>
            <p>It might be fairly Objected, That the preſent <hi>Affrican</hi> Company have carryed on their Trade but very imperfectly as to their own Advantage, (notwithſtanding that was all the Deſign they aimed at) as may be plainly proved from the Care they have taken to ſupply all the Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it being very well known that they have not for theſe 20 Years or more ſent one Ships-loading of Negroes to <hi>Virginia</hi> nor <hi>Maryland,</hi> which are two very large Countreys, and capable of making twice as much To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco as they now do, were they but well ſupplyed with Negroes.</p>
            <p>Every Negro that is ſent into thoſe Plantations, makes as much To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco yearly as pays from 30 <hi>l.</hi> to 40 <hi>l.</hi> Sterl. Cuſtom, but the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny think that is not material to their Stock: They underſtand the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are generally poor, and therefore will not venture to truſt them; whereas at the ſame time private Men have, (tho' with the hazard of being ſeized by the Companies Agents) and had it not been for that Supply thoſe Countries had been in a much worſe Condition than at preſent they are.</p>
            <p>To further demonſtrate what before is hinted at, that the Company have no Forts, Caſtles nor Factories from <hi>Acra</hi> to <hi>Angola,</hi> nor do they ſuppoſe them neceſſary to carry on the Slave-Trade, is plainly proved from their own Practice and Management of that Trade, for when they deſign a Ship to trade for Slaves, they put a Lee-ward Cargo (as they term it) on board the Ship, and give the Maſter or the chief Officer of the Ship full power to diſpoſe, barter and ſell the ſaid Cargo for their Accounts, allowing them a Commiſſion of 4 <hi>per Cent.</hi> for diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the ſaid Cargo, taking on board the Negroes, and delivering them to their Factors in the Plantations, who have uſually been the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of thoſe Places, who have diſpoſed of the Negroes not always to the poor Planters liking, but neceſſity hath no law, ſo muſt ſubmit to the Will and Pleaſure of their Superiours.</p>
            <p>Now this great and growing Evil can only be prevented by permitting more Sellers of Negroes than one, wherefore ſince it is evidently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable, that it is no charge to carry on and manage the Slave-Trade, and of what great Concern it is to encourage and ſupport the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tations, whereby the Navigation of the Kingdom, Revennues of the Crown, and the General Good of this Nation is ſo much advanced, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is humbly hoped that the Trade from <hi>Acra</hi> to <hi>Angola</hi> incluſive may be henceforth judged and allowed to be free and open for all the Subjects of this Kingdom.</p>
